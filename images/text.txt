questrial Regular font - Why NFTs?
questrial Regular font - NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are encoded digital assets that represent real-world objects. Each NFT is unique and cannot be duplicated, thus 			 making it non-fungible. 

			 An NFT empowers a marketing team to pair unique digital assets with the physical products they sell. Brands create NFTs that embody their 			 message—much like in merchandise and memorabilia—and a customer feels proud to own a brand NFT because it is exclusive. NFTs are a key 			 component of Web 3.0 and their market value is expected to reach $18 billion in 2027.
